# Arduino-Temp-Sensor
Fool Proofing measures:
Discount any radically suspicious temperature changes, that would probably come because a wire came loose, or because they tried to short the thermistor.
Only show code if temp change by 7 degrees.
If temperature rises by 4 degrees, it says it's too hot.

There are no logical or syntactical errors in the code, but the changes themselves are yet to be tested.
